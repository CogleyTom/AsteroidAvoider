# Asteroid Avoider
**Mobile game application developed with Unity that allows the user to control a space ship and avoid asteroids**

## Inroduction
This game was developed solely by myself, Thomas Cogley. I utilized the Unity engine to develop the game. It was created with free assets from the Unity marketplace. I used multiple C# scripts to develop the game.  This game is compatible with any mobile device or mobile operating system.

## Purpose of the Game
The purpose of this game is to control a spaceship without being hit by an asteroid.  There are multiple different asteroids that appear in this game.  The screen wraps in the game so if the player goes off screen they appear on the opposite side of the screen.  This was accomplished by reversing the X or Y axis depending on where the ship was headed.

## How to Play
This game is played by avoiding hitting an asteroid with their ship.  To control the ship the user touches the screen and the ship reacts to the touch by moving in the opposite direction.  The longer the player goes without being hit the time on the top of the screen continues to run.  If the user is hit by an asteroid their time is stopped and saved as a high score on the main menu, if it was the highest score they earned.  When the user is hit by an asteroid they have multiple options from the menu that appears.  They can play again, continue, return to menu.  If the user selects play again, the game starts over with a score of 0.  If the user selects continue, they must wach an advertisement and then continue their play through (the user only gets one continue per game).  Finally, if the user returns to menu, they are taken to the main menu to see their high score and play whenever they like.

## Monetization
This game was created with potential to add an advertisement.  I have created an advertisement placeholder, when the user continues on my game, a Unity ad will display.  However, an ad can be inserted into the game by using Unity's monetization options.
